# kita | dotfiles

  Won't be continuting to update this config as I personally dont like the red color scheme. Thought I would still upload to this repo for those that enjoyed seeing it initially.
uploaded to this repo are the config files for yasb, as well as my komorebi config.

# yasb config

  Fair warning the config is very messy, I'm still relatively new to this, so a lot of my solutions for getting the bar to look and function the way I intended are very scuffed.

# Explorer theme

  The theme used for my windows explorer was <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/Quixotic-SE-for-Windows-11-988432646">Quixotic SE by niivu</a>.

# Wallpaper

  Going to be real im unsure who the original artist is for this image (i got it from an osu! beatmap), but I did make further edits to it afterwards in photoshop. The visualizer is created using <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1509243786">CWAV Engine</a> on Wallpaper Engine.
